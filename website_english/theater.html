<h2>Scene 1 (At a Restaurant)</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2:(upset) Oh, my dear friend, I have lost my precious little dog last week!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: You must put an advertisement on the papers!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: (sigh)It's no use, my little dog can't read.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(impatiently) So are you ready to order, gentlemen? I will take another customer’s order if you are not ready.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: OK. (Pick up the menu) How much popcorn are there in the major package?</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(Point[比划一下]):Sure. So much.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: What about the minor package?</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(Still point): So much.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Ah. A major package, please.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: And a large bowl of chicken soup.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: What about drinks? We have all sorts of tea and coffee. Would you like to order any?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Tea, please.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: Me, too, and be sure the cup is clean.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(Write on the list): Sure. Please wait a minute.</p>
(The waiter leaves. Several minutes later, the waiter returns)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: Two teas, and which one asked for the clean glass?</p>
(Customer A and B become speechless.)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: OK. A major package of popcorn, a large bowl of chicken soup, two cups of tea and two clean cups…</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1:(Scared) AH!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: What’s wrong?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1:(Shout) A DEAD FLY! What’s it doing in my soup?</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(calmly) Sir, maybe it is swimming, I think.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: We need another bowl of soup!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: Don’t worry, the spider in the popcorn will get it.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1:(Scared and shout again) SPIDER!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2:(Scared and angry) OH, MY GOD! We’ll never have meal here!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W:(Still calmly) Fine, I’ll change them. Don’t leave.</p>
(The waiter leaves again. Several minutes later, the waiter returns)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: I feel extremely sorry that we made a big mistake. To convey our apologies, here is a large lobster, which is free.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: Why does this lobster have only one claw?</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: I’m sorry again, sir, but it must have fought.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1:(Sighed) Fine, bring me the winner then.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: I’m afraid I can’t, because it is the true winner, and the loser has no claw.</p>
(Customer A and B become speechless.)</p>
<h2>Scene 2 (Outside the restaurant)</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: So delicious and I’m full now.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: So do l.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: It’s an awesome dinner, the foods are tasty, thank you.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: You are welcome. </p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: By the way, it’s not early now, let’s leave.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: OK. Don’t forget to pay the check.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: Sure. (Look at the waiter) Waiter! Give me the check.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: OK, wait a moment, please.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: (Open the purse and look) Oh, no! I only have 50 dollars in all in my pocket!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: What? 50 dollars? I think we must pay at least 200 dollars!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: I’m sorry, but, l really don’t have money. Would you pay for me?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: l pay for you? You said it’s your treat! </p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: Help me, please. I’ll give the money back to you tomorrow, I promise.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1:You have said you’ll pay for the meal, but don’t bring enough money, how fun you are! (Open the wallet and look) Oh, no! l haven’t brought any money! </p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: (Come)Here’s your check, Sir. Please have a look.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: (Ignore the waiter) Why don’t you carry any money with you?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: You said it’s your treat!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: Here’s your check. And…</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: (Continue ignore) You don’t take any money. How can you come here?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: My home is only 10-minute walk from here.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: OK. You should pay 240 dollars, Sir.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: (still ignore) But…</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: (Shout)Don’t ignore me!! </p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Oh, I’m sorry. Give me the check. (Look the check)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Err…, I think there’s something wrong on the check, please check it.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: Really? Give me the check, wait a moment. (Turn back and leave)</p>
(Several minutes later)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: We are safe now. Let’s escape from here.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: Escape? Will you be afraid if they call the police?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: So, what can we do?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: You can use your phone to pay.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Are you kidding me? My iPhone XS is far more expensive than this meal!</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: But it’s the only way to save us. By the way, you can take it back tomorrow.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Hey, since you home is near from here, you can go home to fetch some money. </p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: What? You said it’s your treat and let me go home to fetch money. I’ll remember you! (Leave)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: (Later) Err…Waiter, my friend has gone home to fetch money, just wait 10 minutes.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: OK.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: What may happen to him? Maybe I’ll ask my other friends for help. (Call)</p>
Voice: The number you have dialed is power off.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Let me change a person.</p>
Voice: The number you have dialed is power off.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Let me change again.</p>
Voice: The number you have dialed is power off.</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: Oh! What kind of friends they are!</p>
(Customer 2 is back.)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(38,81,107);">C2: I’m sorry to tell you a piece of BAD news, I forget to take my keys with me when l leave home, so…</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: What? Oh my God!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: (Come)Hey, my friends, can you pay the check now?</p>
<p style="color:rgb(79,121,108);">C1: (Take the check) There’s another mistake on the check.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(180,76,76);">W: That’s impossible! Figure it out!</p>
